1.Router has a link State
Cost: depends on Bandwidth
cost=10000/Bandwidth; 
R1 has a link state with R2. LSA( Link State Advertisement) broadcast its information to its neighbouring state.
2. All the LSAs are stored in LSBD( Link State Database)
	
	Steps:
		-Neighbour
		-Exchange LSDB
		-Choose the best path
	Dijsktra Algorithm is used to calculate the path distance and assign the shortest path.
	
			r1->||<-r4		if the link state database of r1 changes, r1 will let its neighbours 
	 		r2->||<-r5		Know. But then , its neighbour also sends its neighbours. Here, a 
			r3->||<-r6		situtation occur where traffic is huge due to all the routers being 
							connected together.
		In order to solve the issue, a Designation Router ID is assigned. A router will be made as 
	designated router. Designated router will send all the information. Router ID is assigned to make one  particular ID as Designated Router . Only packets from Designated Router are accepted others are rejected.

In Cisco Packet Tracer,
	in a router config mode -> ospf-> mention wildcard mask -> mention area 
Wildcard mask: ip address 192.168.10.0 subnet mask 255.255.255.0
				so it can be from 192.168.10.0 to 192.168.10.255 
					wildcard mask  is 0.0.0.255 
Area: let's assign it 0

router ->en
router ->config
router(config>->Router ospf ls
router(config-ospf)->Network {wildcard mask} area 0
Use ip route to see the whole connectivity.

If a network goes down, {Suppose we have shut down a router} ,
			after calling ip route, we can see an updated route with updated path(Shortest)
between ip addresses.
In a router, it is possible to assign bandwidth.
Make a bandwidth slower observe the network.
go to a particular interface
router(config-if)->Bandwidth 1 (bandwidth is assigned 1 Kbps)
router(config-if)->No Bandwidth (bandwidth is unset)
