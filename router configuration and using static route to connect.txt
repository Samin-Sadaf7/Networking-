Direct connection between two Switch does not work. If two switches have different network address
then we need a layer 3 device.

Router: layer 3 device

Same network address -> Interface 

->Broadcast Domain<-


Router CLI:
		router->en 
		
		? to know the commands
		
		Configure command to configure the router

Steps:
	-> Set up ip address
	-> in router , set up interface
exit command to get out
	ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 no shutdown

when we do a ping command 
		Router is the gateway 
		if we do not have the same subnet mask , then the packets will be sent to router .


Default gateway 
	If the ip address is not in the same subnet, multicast/broadcast address, it will exit through default gateway.

If the default gateway is not set , the packets will be dropped.

Router to router is connected using serial port

show running-config 
copy running-config startup-config

Serial Cable --> DCE and DTE
Clock speed set up 
	DCE v DTE

Router to router should have same subnet for direct communication

To set up clock rate
	clock rate value;
ip route ip address subnet mask  forwarding ip address;

show ip route;<- to see the route

Default route
		: ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 port-number/ip address;
