Static Routing Protocol :
			
		R1 		R3
		
		R2		R4
		
	if R2 and R3 have a path between them 
		What if the link is broken
		IN static Routing, we manually change the path

Dynamic Routing: 
		
		So, in this case, the route change dynamically when a certain path is not available
		
RIP(Routing Information Protocol):

		1.Distance Vector Routing 
		Network Address 192.168.1.0/24
				so Broadcast address is 192.168.1.225
		
		Instead of sending the packets to everyone, multicast will send it out to certain
		nodes
		VLSM(Variable Length Subnet Mask)
		it uses classless addressing 
			
		
	RIPv1 				RIPv2 				RIPng

1.Broadcast			  1.Multicast 			1.Multicast
2.No VLSM			  2.VLSM				2.VLSM
3.ip version 4 		  3.ip version 4 		3.ip version 6
4.no authentication   4.authenticated 		4.authenticated 


Metric : Hop Count (Number of routers to pass to go the destination)
			

		N2 ---> N3

		N2---R1------R2--N4
			 |		  |
			N1		  N3
		
From the perspective of R1 ,

		Network name  HopCount
			N1		    0
			N2 			0 
			N3 			1
			N4			1
	HopCount:16 means unavialable 


Timers : 
		UpdateTimer: 
					Default time : 30s 
					(it is a periodic update 
								not a trigger update)	
					Invalid		  	
					Hold down
					Flush	
		       
		Inconsistenecy happens:
				Solution : 
					-Split Horizon (Don't broadcast it to host)
					-Poison Reverse
								Pass it as 16 value 

Code for RIP enable:
		Go to config mode of router

		then :

			*Router rip
			 version 2
			network ip address(connected to it) 
					(all the ip addresses of interfaces)

			//do it for the other routers

			show ip router 
			// for checking the routing table
