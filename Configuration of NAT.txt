Configuration of NAT(Network Address Translation) 
			-Basic idea is to allow multiple devices to use one public ip address

Shortage of IP address: 
				two types of IP address:
										-Public IP Address
										-Private IP address
Two different networks , 
 
			Basically NAT protocol changes the ip address (Public to private or Private to Public)
Router with NAT configuration maintain a map to local end devices and as well as the port.

Processes:
			-build topology
			-assign ip address as well as default gateway
			- go to router enable mode  then terminal (each interface )to assign ip address accordingly		
			: command ip address ip addess1  default gateway

			- main task
			Steps: 
				1. Create an Access list:
										#access_list <ACC_ID_NO>  permit/deny match_parameter				                                   <wildcard>
				2. Pool:
										# ip nat pool <pool name> <ip range> netmask subnet_mask
										# ip nat inside source  1 (Access ID No) pool pool1

				*need mention inside and outside in the command line

			Go to router: config terminal 
				-> access_list 1 permit 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 

				->	ip nat pool pool1 50.0.0.1 50.0.0.10  netmask 255.0.0.0 	
										(starting to ending)

				-> ip nat inside source list 1 pool pool1

				initialize interfaces as inside and outside	

					---> Router-> en->config-> interface int_name-> ip nat inside-> exit
					---> Router-> en->config-> interface int_name-> ip nat outside-> exit

			On the other side of the router, only one server is present , there is no need to create an access list because only one device is connected
		command for it would be:
				# ip nat inside source static ip addess1 netmask subnet mask1 
			
			access-list 2 permit 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255
			ip nat inside source list 2 pool pool1
			ping to check whether packets are being sent or not
			permit option: router numbers, any and host
			
			to check how the nat protocol is handled -> router ->end
